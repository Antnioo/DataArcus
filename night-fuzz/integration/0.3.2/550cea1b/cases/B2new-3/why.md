# B2new-3 (B2new): new overlap introduced

Branch integration/0.3.2, head 550cea1bac7aed446ba17b56dec4f7c5bc13a0e3. Previous head 771e279a54dcf6900cf4d49f430f246b4134c00b.

**OLD (fails on previous head too).**

Found by: generated, seeds 2026111823 (lab copy in the night lab; the reduced spec is deletion-minimal under the lab's reducer).

## Cause (file:line at the head)

- `mcp/lib/twin-pages.mjs:253`: MX7 rule: a chart lined up with a heatmap grid takes English's offset from the grid left edge; nothing checks what it lands on
