# Power BI Desktop tests

Some fixes can only be proven in real Power BI. This file keeps what was tested there, how, and what we learned.
Setup: Claude Code on the laptop with Microsoft's `powerbi-authoring` plugin (Power BI Authoring MCP), the Desktop
bridge CLI (`powerbi-desktop`) and the DataArcus MCP (`mcp/`). Test models carry data with known answers, so every
expected number is written down before the run.

## 2026-09-29: Power BI Desktop 2.157 (August 2026)

| Fix | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| A1 Last Ramadan measure | Calendar from the calendar generator, Sales = (Hijri year - 1440) x 100 + Ramadan day, 17 values: every year 2022-2027, Ramadan days 1/5/29/30, totals, old vs new measure | PASS, all 17 |
| D1 fix plan keeps refresh working | Model Health fix plan on a model with Month Year, Month Number, Year Month: TMDL quick fixes, review-folder script, Power Query removals, mark date table, refresh | PASS, refresh OK, months in date order |
| D2 measures table keeps its column | Same run: _Measures[Column1] still there | PASS |
| D6 TMDL quoting | Format string `"Yes";"Yes";"No"` through the review-folder TMDL script | PASS, unchanged |
| C2 theme font sizes | Themes from the live generator with custom pages 3840 x 2160 (font 84) and 640 x 360 (font 5), inside a project made with the DataArcus MCP | FAIL as reported: Power BI refuses the whole theme ("must be <= 60", "must be >= 8"). Fixed: sizes kept within 8-60 |
| D5 aggregation tables | Manage aggregations needs a DirectQuery detail table; an Import-only test model cannot have one | Not testable here. Shipped because it can only mark tables as used (worst case: same as before) |

## Lessons
- **Prompts for the laptop agent:** start with the request itself, name every file, forbid changing the test files or the expected numbers, and say "stop and report on failure". Give the exact report format.
- **What the agent can do alone:** create tables, relationships and measures, run DAX, mark date tables, refresh, screenshot one page at a time.
- **What still needs a person:** applying TMDL scripts in TMDL view (no tool for it), Power Query edits that remove columns (the MCP updates the M but not the column mappings; Desktop's Close & Apply does), saving files.
- **Quirks:** a relationship created through the API needs a Calculate refresh before queries work. `powerbi-desktop screenshot-all` failed with REPORT_DIR_REQUIRED on a generated project (per page works). A screenshot can leave a borderless capture window open. The Modeling MCP can show a stale copy after changes made in Desktop until it reconnects.
- **Test models written by hand** have no lineage tags, so TMDL createOrReplace scripts generated from them give objects new tags. Models exported from Desktop carry the tags.
- Power BI Desktop saves projects as TMDL by default, so the DataArcus MCP should read TMDL in `check_model_health` (today it asks for a .pbit).

## To do (DataArcus MCP)
- `check_model_health` on TMDL projects.
- A tool to apply a TMDL script to the open model, or a clear hand-off step.
- Find why `screenshot-all` fails on generated projects.
- Share the theme and layout engine with the website so the MCP can design full pages.
