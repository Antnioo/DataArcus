# Current work (the memory between sessions)

Read this first; update it as you go (rules in `mcp/CLAUDE.md`, "Keeping the memory"). Last updated 2026-10-01
by the builder: `fix/phone-and-sizes` round 3 (Reset, page buttons) approved; see "Next step" and the working notes.

## Where things stand
- **MCP: 6 tools** (`read_model`, `suggest_fields`, `check_model_health`, `generate_theme`, `plan_layout`,
  `create_report`), 77 checks in `npm test`; all 16 website suites pass.
- **Phase 2 (design engine in the MCP): built, merged and checked in Desktop.** `generate_theme` and `plan_layout`
  reproduce the website byte for byte on all 54 design fixtures; `create_report` builds the website's project
  download from a design (60 project fixtures). Details: `mcp/PHASE2-SPEC.md`.
- **Report fixes merged** (buttons' "show" outside the state, tooltip page sizes, logo placeholder, field choice
  for untyped columns, `modelNotes`), and verified in Power BI Desktop 2.157 on "Gulf Sales AR 2": all 8 checks PASS
  (`scripts/tests/DESKTOP-TESTS.md`).

- **Table fix merged** (owner found it on "Gulf Sales AR 2": the Arabic title "جدول التفاصيل" on
  the far right, the table on the far left): tables now set `columnHeaders.columnAdjustment: growToFit` and
  `autoSizeColumnWidth: true` (Microsoft's table reference: always grow to fit; without it columns shrink to their
  content); in right-to-left reports the table's columns are reversed so the category column sits on the right;
  `modelNotes` also tells day names without a sort-by column (days showed Friday, Monday, ...). 3 new MCP checks
  (75), failing before; all 16 website suites pass. `pbip-export.min.js?v=20260930f`, `theme-generator.min.js?v=20260930h`.
  **Checked in Power BI Desktop 2.157 on "Gulf Sales AR 3": all 6 checks PASS** (both tables fill their width, Day
  Name rightmost, the three `modelNotes`, everything else identical to AR 2, KPI values equal DAX;
  `scripts/tests/DESKTOP-TESTS.md`).
- **Cards moved to `cardVisual`** (merged, `e22b346`; the plan and sizes table are in branch commit `6a7ecd3`'s
  WORK.md): KPI cards and the tooltip card use `cardVisual` with role `Data`, value and title sizes fitted to each card
  by `cardFit` in `pbip-export.js`, the number centred, label and inner outline off; phone sizes in `mobile.json`
  (title 10, value 20). The theme is unchanged (it already styles `cardVisual`) and no fixture changed. Microsoft's
  default number format is kept (101.914K; owner's decision, forcing decimals would show counts as 47.00). MCP 77
  checks, all 16 website suites pass. **Desktop 2.157: six reports PASS on items 1-6**; item 7 (phone) FAIL from the
  old phone-position bug (open item); item 8 skipped by the owner (a hand-added card following the theme is Power
  BI's own behaviour). `pbip-export.min.js?v=20260930g`, `theme-generator.min.js?v=20260930i`.
- **Website dropdowns fixed** (merged): the open list was white on white on every tool page; form fields now use
  `color-scheme: dark` with dark option colours (`assets/css/style.css`), checked on every tool page in `tools.mjs`.

## Next step (reviewer, 2026-10-01): `fix/phone-and-sizes` merged into main as `f8d911f`
Full run on Linux before the merge: 15 of 16 suites pass, `anchors` failed once under load (known flake, open item)
and passes alone; MCP 87 pass; tree identical to the branch. The branch's plan, measurements and Desktop results are
in its history (`b931ecd`) and `scripts/tests/DESKTOP-TESTS.md`.

**Order from here (owner's go; details in `mcp/ROADMAP.md`):**
1. **Reviewer:** split `assets/js/pbip-export.js` into small modules (output byte for byte identical), then CI (every
   suite on every push). **Nobody else touches `pbip-export.js` until that merges.**
2. **Builder, at the same time, plan only** (branch `plan/next-rounds`): (a) phone text sizes per visual in
   `mobile.json` (slicer boxes cut on the phone at 1080, page-sized text too big at 2160; measure first) plus a
   Desktop check of the slide-in panel (Close and Filters, EN and AR); (b) Arabic accuracy (Arabic display names in
   `create_report`; day and month sort order and measures without a format string as health findings with TMDL
   fix scripts, weeks starting Saturday or Sunday).
3. Builder builds (a) and (b) after the split merges; then the design summary, packaging, private-repo move, beta,
   launch. **Dated:** the Gulf Calendar pack ready by 2026-12-01.

**Testing speed (owner 2026-10-01):** the builder runs only the failing tests and the suites a change touches; the
reviewer runs the full run on Linux before every merge (and CI on every push once added). No 15-minute full runs on
the laptop unless the reviewer asks.

## Open items (flagged, need the owner's go before any work)
- **Next round, after `fix/phone-and-sizes` (owner 2026-10-01; plan only, then "go"):**
  - **Arabic reports show English titles** ("Total Sales حسب Quarter", English KPI names, table headers, slicer titles):
    measure and column names come from the model. Plan: `create_report` takes optional display names per field; in
    an Arabic report, every field without an Arabic name is listed in the notes. No made-up translations.
  - **Days and months sort alphabetically** (Friday, Monday, ...; April, August, ...): `Calendar[Day Name]` and
    `Calendar[Month Name]` have no sort-by column (in `modelNotes` since "Gulf Sales AR 3"). Plan: a model health
    finding with a ready TMDL script that sets the sort column for day and month names, covering a week that starts on
    Saturday or Sunday. The model is still never changed without the user.
  - **Measures without a format string**, as model health findings: the % card shows 0.34 (Sales[Total Sales vs Last
    Ramadan %]); the table shows 101914 while the cards show 101.914K.
- **Small-page round, with the 640 x 360 cards (after the next round):**
  - **KPI cards cut at 640 x 360** (already on main): the numbers in the 42- and 48-high cards are cut at the bottom.
    Measured (2.158, `scripts/tests/DESKTOP-TESTS.md`): 8pt title / value 12 needs 48, value 14 needs 56 on 640 x 360,
    but 44 on 1920 x 1080 and 3840 x 2160; 42pt cards on 1080 need 88 (126 and 144 fine). No single rule fits yet:
    measure 1280 x 720, 960 x 720, 1366 x 768, 700 x 525, 2560 x 1440 and 640 x 360 again (steps of 2, the card as
    `cardFit` writes it there), then a rule by page size or a table; 1080 and up keep 42-60 (owner).
  - **Long KPI titles end in "..."** on 640 x 360 (8pt, Power BI's minimum).
  - **Charts on 640 x 360:** month and day labels slanted and cut ("Wednes..."); "Total Sales by Quarter" hides Q4
    behind a scrollbar.
  - **Detail table on 640 x 360:** shows two rows with scrollbars, and its fourth column is cut.
- **Table header alignment** (seen on "Gulf Sales AR 3"): headers are left aligned while numbers are right aligned,
  so on a wide table each number sits nearer the next column's header than its own. Stays as it is (owner).
- **Flaky tests on a busy laptop:** `consent` ("Berlin: no banner") and `anchors` (home page #contact) failed once
  each under load and pass alone. They don't use `ready()` yet (`scripts/tests/lib.mjs`).
- **Phase 3:** background PNGs from the engine's SVG (first test whether Power BI accepts the SVG itself).
- **Roadmap after that:** Arabic/right-to-left and Gulf DAX in a private repo, then packaging (`mcp/ROADMAP.md`).

## How to work (short)
- Plan first, wait for "go"; tests first; one writer on the repo at a time; branch → push → the reviewer tests and
  merges; never merge yourself. Keep the laptop awake during full runs.
